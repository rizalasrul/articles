# Why Every Programmers Should Start Blogging

Hola. This is my first post in Medium. To start it, I won’t write about any technical issues. I will start my wrote with one of my anxieties, “every programmer must write”, or at least have a blog. FYI, I already wrote in my personal blog in [here].

## Why blogging is worth for programmers?
Writing is one of many way to make a legacy in life, whether it’s through books, scientific publications, or online articles. If a programmers write about backend technology, then he creating legacy at the field of backend development. In the digital era, blog is the best platform. Every people can write in a blog, because the simplicity.
As a programmer, we have learn a lot of technology, and sometimes we forget about it. Imagine that you forgot about xxx technology, and then you search with “xxx tutorial” keyword. Then that comes out is an article from your blog that you wrote a few years ago. So your blog has saved yourself from ignorance.

## Blogging makes our technical skills developed
Blogging often push us to do many experiments. If in real project we do manipulation array using only a few built-in method, then in blog we can manipulate the array deeply with various condition. Because we know that blog has broader audience than our real project. Audience or reader will look our code style and how deep our skill. Our writing should be something that can be accounted for.

## Are you bored with a mainstream technology tutorial? Create a something new!
Have you been stuck when developing a web application using rails or golang, but when you search in google the result just “*PHP tutorial*” or “*web development using PHP*”? No, I didn’t said that PHP is bad. It’s just a tutorial about PHP is too much. So, if you doing project with anti-mainstream technology (for now), then it’s can be your chance to create one.

## There are always people who starting out programming
We don’t have to start blogging with something new or hype. We can start with the basic of programming, like variable, function, looping, and another cool stuff (back to basic is cool stuff). Because believe me, there will always be new people out there who just start do programming, and they need something basic.

## Branding for programmers.
Like I said before, the content of our blog can represent our skill or knowledge. In fact, writing is a result of thinking that does not come in the blink of an eye and can be made a mature concept. Our blog can provide opportunities for others to learn and give a positive vibes. Through writing on blogs, programmers get new opportunities such as a speaker in a tech conference, or a trainer in some workshops, or even be collaborated by other programmers. That’s sounds great, right.

## Conclusion
Just do blogging, programmers.
